# Neural network that take 2 inputs:
    1. an image from the MNIST dataset (say 5), and
    2. a random number between 0 and 9, (say 7)
# gives two outputs:
    1. the "number" that was represented by the MNIST image (predict 5), and
    2. the "sum" of this number with the random number and the input image to the network (predict 5 + 7 = 12)
